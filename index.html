		<h2>YEHY!!! You did it! Here is your late present bozo I tried</h2>
		<p>Happy belated birthday and here is the actual letter and gift/s if you count this code LOL I know this took a while but hopefully you didn't think I forgot! I been trying to grind it out but by myself with the help of ChatGPT but still I did all that format stuff!</p>
		<p>Anyways, I love you very much and you are the best person to ever come into my life! I am very grateful for you and I hope that you feel it as well. You are my bestest friend in the whole world and I hope I can make you feel safe and loved. I know I have my faults that seem cold, but I promise that you are very loved by me and Mini Boss! I will always try to do better.</p>
		<p>I also want to say thank you for showing me love for the past several months. Thank you for being a great gaming buddy and for listening to me. I hope that I can be someone you know you can depend on if ever things feel rough for you. I hope that you trust me wholeheartedly as I do for you. I hope you know that I think you’re the best guy in the world and the most handsomest and most goofiest. I also hope that soon you will overcome the things you don't tell me about, whether it is about me, this relationship, or your own thoughts or struggles or anything else. I am always here for you and I want you to have no doubt about it. Also, know that I think you are a very ambitious, hardworking, and handsome man! I am so sure that your future is very bright and rewarding. I will always be your no.1 cheerleader! Remember to do your best in everything you do! Do your best to be kind to yourself as well, and I hope you are proud of yourself because I really am proud of you.</p>
		<p>I’m really happy I get to spend so much time with you as well. I still have a crush on you and I know there are ladies out there eyeballing you up and down but regardless I am grateful I get to spend this much time with you and you seem eager to hang out with me every day. Those old ladies better know their place I’ma say that. One shove and they’re done so *shrug emoji* One kick and they done hope they know that! I want you in my future so you better have more birthdays. I love you very much. I hope this year treats you well and that you achieve the things you have been wishing to accomplish.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you bozo, I love you a lot and happy birthday!</p>
